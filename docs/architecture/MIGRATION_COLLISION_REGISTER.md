# Migration collision register

A **human-reviewed** integration register, not a renumbering tool. It records which open branch claims
which migration number, where two branches claim the same one, and what is intended. Nothing here
renumbers anything automatically. A branch changes its own numbers when its author rebases it, and the
change is reviewed in that branch's PR.

**How to refresh it.** Run the scan below against `origin/main` and every remote branch, then update the
tables by hand:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
for b in $(git branch -r | grep -v HEAD | sed 's#  origin/##'); do
  for f in $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A origin/main...origin/$b -- drizzle/ | grep -E 'drizzle/0[0-9]{3}_.*\.sql$'); do
    echo "$(basename $f) | $b | base $(git merge-base origin/main origin/$b | cut -c1-7)"
  done
done | sort
```

**Rule of thumb** (a convention, not automation): the first branch to merge keeps its number, and every
other claimant takes the next number free on `main` *and* on all open branches at its own rebase.
Reserved slots `0016`/`0017` are never used (CI gate 0). `0094`, `0095` and `0098` are historical gaps,
and `0157` is historically used twice. None of those is reused.

## State at C1a integration (2026-09-23, `main` = `6b01a0e`, after PR #4 and PR #5)

`main` migration head: **`0169_defect_resolution.sql`** (PR #4). PR #5 added none.

## Change log

* **2026-09-23**: created at C1a integration. C1a moved `0172 → 0174` because
  `claude/training-academy-workforce-q3mdse` had claimed `0172`/`0173` since the Checkpoint 0 survey.
  No other branch was renumbered.
* **2026-09-23**: the driver-portfolio branch merged `main` (`42c454f`) and moved `0169 → 0175` and
  `0170 → 0176`, the first two numbers held by neither `main` nor any open branch (0170–0173 are
  claimed by #9/#11 and the training-academy branch; 0174 is on main). `claude/leaseos-auth-workspace-system-t008ad`
  still claims 0170 and should take the next free number at its own rebase.
