# Migration collision register

A **human-reviewed** integration register, not a renumbering tool. It records which open branch claims
which migration number, where two branches claim the same one, and what is intended. Nothing here
renumbers anything automatically. A branch changes its own numbers when its author rebases it, and the
change is reviewed in that branch's PR.

**How to refresh it.** Run the scan below against `origin/main` and every remote branch, then update the
tables by hand:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
for b in $(git branch -r | grep -v HEAD | sed 's#  origin/##'); do
  for f in $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A origin/main...origin/$b -- drizzle/ | grep -E 'drizzle/0[0-9]{3}_.*\.sql$'); do
    echo "$(basename $f) | $b | base $(git merge-base origin/main origin/$b | cut -c1-7)"
  done
done | sort
```

**Rule of thumb** (a convention, not automation): the first branch to merge keeps its number, and every
other claimant takes the next number free on `main` *and* on all open branches at its own rebase.
Reserved slots `0016`/`0017` are never used (CI gate 0). `0094`, `0095` and `0098` are historical gaps,
and `0157` is historically used twice. None of those is reused.

## Current state (2026-09-23, `main` = `42c454f`, after PR #4, PR #5 and C1a #12)

`main` migration head: **`0174_dispatch_override_provenance.sql`**. `main` holds `0169` (PR #4) and
`0174` (C1a); `0170`–`0173` are open on `main` and claimed only by branches.

| Number | Migration file | Branch | PR | Base (merge-base with main) | Status | Collision | Intended resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0169 | `0169_defect_resolution.sql` | *(main)* | #4 | — | **on main** | vs `0169_driver_portfolio` | main owns 0169 |
| 0169 | `0169_driver_portfolio.sql` | `claude/driver-portfolio-credential-wallet-ya8928` | none | `3911f59` | open branch, no PR | **collides with main** | its author renumbers at rebase onto main |
| 0170 | `0170_driver_portfolio_events_append_only.sql` | `claude/driver-portfolio-credential-wallet-ya8928` | none | `3911f59` | open branch, no PR | with #9, #11, auth-workspace | renumber at rebase |
| 0170 | `0170_dispatch_role_types.sql` | `feature/dispatch-role-assignment-backend` | #9 | `42c454f` | PR open against `main`, main merged in | with auth-workspace, driver-portfolio | #9 is nearest to merge and **proposes to keep 0170/0171**; owner to confirm |
| 0170 | `0170_dispatch_role_types.sql` | `feature/dispatch-assignment-ui` | #11 | `e6b65f2` | PR open, stacked on #9 | inherited from #9 (same file) | follows #9 |

| 0171 | `0171_dispatch_role_assignment_events.sql` | `feature/dispatch-role-assignment-backend` | #9 | `42c454f` | PR open | inherited copy on #11 only | follows #9 |
| 0171 | `0171_dispatch_role_assignment_events.sql` | `feature/dispatch-assignment-ui` | #11 | `e6b65f2` | PR open, stacked on #9 | inherited from #9 | follows #9 |

| 0173 | `0173_wallet_history_guards.sql` | `claude/training-academy-workforce-q3mdse` | none | `0060690` | open branch, no PR | none | keeps 0173 |
| 0174 | `0174_dispatch_override_provenance.sql` | *(main)* | #12 | — | **on main** | none | — |

**Next free number for new work: `0175`** (re-check with the scan above before committing).

## Change log

* **2026-09-23**: C1a merged (#12, `42c454f`), so `0174` is on main. PR #9 was brought onto main (merge-base `42c454f`).
* **2026-09-23**: created at C1a integration. C1a moved `0172 → 0174` because
  `claude/training-academy-workforce-q3mdse` had claimed `0172`/`0173` since the Checkpoint 0 survey.
  No other branch was renumbered.
